% In order to make the amount of distributed files samll, this file includes
% esample.tex in a tricky way to print it in the draft style with LaTeX2e.
% So, don't follow this sample, but replace \documentstyle in the
% esample.tex with \documentclass[english,draft]{ipsjpapers} to have the
% real sample file of draft versions for LaTeX2e.
