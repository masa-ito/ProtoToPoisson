Welcome to ProtoToPoisson's documentation!
==========================================

Summary
-------

What is ProtoToPoisson? 

    * A mini-EDSL (embedded domain-specific language) for prototyping and parallelizing Poisson equation solvers with FVM (finite volume method)

A problem we are trying to resolve

    * A conflict between expressiveness of simulation program source code and performace of its executable code

Project Goal

    * Providing an expressive EDSL for Poisson equation solvers with a smaller conflict with performance

Project period
    * Jan. 2015 - Sep. 2016 (or until my temporary transfer from Fujitsu to JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) ends.)
